# Snake Game

Welcome to Snake Game, this is a classic arcade game I implemented using the `pygame` library. Basically, you guide a snake around the screen as it grows by eating apples. And, the game ends if you run into the screen's edges or into the snake itself!

## Features

### 1. **Snake Movement**
- Move the snake using the arrow keys.
- The snake grows by one block each time it consumes an apple.
- The game is over if it collides with itself or goes out of bounds.

### 2. **Apple Consumption**
- Randomly placed apples appear on the screen.
- Apples can be consumed by the snake to increase its length.

### 3. **Game Over and Reset**
- If the snake collides with itself or the screen's edges, the game ends.
- A game over screen displays the final score.
- Press the Enter key to play again.

### 4. **Score Display**
- The score is displayed on the screen, representing the snake's current length.

### 5. **Customizable Snake Size**
- The snake and apple sizes are customizable using the `SNAKE_SIZE` variable.

### 6. **Graphics**
- The game features simple and colorful graphics for an engaging gaming experience.
